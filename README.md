## About The Project

This is the first project in the main curriculum @ Microverse. The task consists in

> [...] building an HTML document that matches the appearance of youtube video player page.

First we used nav tags to create a nice looking navbar. Further down we used a lot of rows and columns to create that two-leveled effect where you can see a picture right next to a chunk of text.

We are especially proud of having incorporated Sprites to our sourcecode. This is seen with the file Toolbar.png which is used for 4 seperate icons on the webpage.
